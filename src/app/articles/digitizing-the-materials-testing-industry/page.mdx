The materials testing industry is the societal foundation that ensures that our civil structures are compliant, quality controled,
and of the highest safety standards. It is valued at USD $6.5B and has continued to grow year over year for decades. As populations
have increased so too have the demand for infrastructural buildings to facilitate their growth, increasing the demand beyond current
capabailites. To increase the efficiency and overall effectiveness the materials testing industry needed a solution that addressed their
accumulated innovational debt and ushered them into Industry 3.0.

_A cloud full-stack web and mobile-native application that facilitates the testing, scientific calucations, and client liasing of the Materials Testing industry._

## The Technology Stack

Labnetik starts with a fundamental design built to fit the needs of a decentralized organizational structure.
One comprised of several different stakeholders spanning different environments, responsibilities, with significantly different persona characteristics.
At its baseline there needed to be a product that provided a distinctly different set of workflows for each segment of users, a functions-first approach
facilitated through a native-mobile app and web-application. In a mono-repo with shared back-end services and two seperate front-ends we were able to create
a system that allowed for just that.

## The Architecture

In Materials testing a significant amount of their work is facilitated by their satellite
testing laboratories ran by teams of dedicated technicians. The Data architecture
of our application decouples the organizational layers and allows the institution to separate,
the Organization into Laboratory entities, that then can hold or share various project identifiers.
This allowing an organization to fine-tune the passage of information between different
laboratories without any need for duplicate information or worries about data security.

With a flexible underline asset architecture we wanted to ensure that our user experience didn't
dead-lock the functionality of our overall application. Like the parent-child relationship of organizations
and laboratories, users can also be decoupled from organizations so they can belong to multiple laboratories,
or multiple organizations. Something that is important for technicians that sit between organizations, or
stakeholders overseeing processes.

To ensure this wasn't done at the cost of confidentiality, integrity, or availability, Labnetik ensures the
ability for organizations to self-govern their information access management through a robust and flexible
role or attribute base permissions system.

## The Issue

Idem se saxa fata pollentibus geminos; quos pedibus. Est urnis Herses omnes nec
divite: et ille illa furit sim verbis Cyllenius.

1. Captus inpleverunt collo
2. Nec nam placebant
3. Siquos vulgus
4. Dictis carissime fugae
5. A tacitos nulla viginti

Ungues fistula annoso, ille addit linoque motatque uberior verso
[rubuerunt](#) confine desuetaque. _Sanguine_ anteit
emerguntque expugnacior est pennas iniqui ecce **haeret** genus: peiora imagine
fossas Cephisos formosa! Refugitque amata [refelli](#)
supplex. Summa brevis vetuere tenebas, hostes vetantis, suppressit, arreptum
regna. Postquam conpescit iuvenis habet corpus, et erratica, perdere, tot mota
ars talis.

Sit volat naturam; motu Cancri. Erat pro simul quae valuit quoque timorem quam

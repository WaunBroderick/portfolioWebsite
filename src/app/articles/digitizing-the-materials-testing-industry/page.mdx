The materials testing industry is a societal foundation that ensures that our civil structures are compliant, quality controled,
and of the highest safety standards. It is valued at USD $6.5B and has continued to grow year over year for decades. As populations
have increased so too have the demand for infrastructural buildings to facilitate their growth, increasing the demand beyond current
capabailites. To increase the efficiency and overall effectiveness the materials testing industry needed a solution that addressed their
innovational debt and ushered them into a new digitized era.

## The Technology Stack <a name="technology"></a>

Labnetik starts with a fundamental design built to fit the needs of a decentralized organizational structure.
One comprised of several stakeholders spanning different environments, responsibilities, and significantly different persona characteristics.
At its baseline there needed to be a product that provided a distinctly different set of workflows for each segment of user. To meet the need we created a functions-first design
facilitated through a native-mobile app and web-application.

## The Architecture <a name="architecture"></a>

In Materials testing a significant amount of their work is facilitated by their satellite
testing laboratories ran by teams of dedicated technicians. The Data architecture
of our application decouples the organizational layers and allows the institution to separate,
the Organization into Laboratory entities, that can hold or share various data objects.
This allows the organization to fine-tune the passage of information between different
laboratories without any need for duplicate information or worries about data security.

With a flexible underline asset architecture we wanted to ensure that our user experience didn't
dead-lock the functionality of our overall application. Like the parent-child relationship of organizations
and laboratories, users can also be decoupled from organizations so they can belong to multiple laboratories,
or multiple organizations. Something that is important for technicians that sit between organizations, like
stakeholders overseeing regional processes.

To ensure this wasn't done at the cost of confidentiality, integrity, or availability, Labnetik ensures the
ability for organizations to self-govern their information access management through a robust and flexible
role or attribute base permissions system.

From a technical perspective the application was built on a monorepo in a monolithic arhitecture that was designed
to be observable, flexible and scalable. From a product development perspective we were adament about developing
a client-centric architecture that aligned with a product hierarchy of values that we believed would ensure the
best adoption from the indsutry. Without listing every design decision of our architecture we can assert that we
built everything with the following in mind; Security & data handling, compliance, client & employee management,
Automation & Optimization.

## The Workflow <a name="workflows"></a>

Labnetik did many things, but it's core foundation was an engine for business process automation. Due to the the
breadth of stakeholders,diversity in roles, and distributed locations the handling of documents was of the highest
importance. Labnetik needed the kernel of its innovation to start with digitizing and simplifying document handling.
That alone was no easy feat...

To go through all of the workflows that were ingested and broken down into; swimlanes, process diagrams, and
other visualizations would require more time than intended to take in this product document. Instead only one of the most
common workflows is visualized below. This is in itself an abstraction and simplification of a generic test, but has enough
information to provide a general understanding of the complexity of the workflows.

## Features <a name="features"></a>

With a shared reference of understanding we can start to examine some of the features that were built to facilitate
the needs of this workflow alone.

All of these features contributed to the overall success of the application in providing a solution that increased
their productivity, efficiency, and effectivness.

## The Outcomes

Labnetik was one of over 5+ projects that the team at _Gyroscopic Inc_ delivered in its 4 years of operation.
The product was one of our two main revenue lines that helped us ultimately secure our +3M in funding to
continue our growth. It saw adoption from some of the largest materials testing companies in the North America
and was met with praise from several industry partners.

Due to a series of business variables & market factors, the company was ultimately dissolved in 2023. At the moment
the landing page can still be seen at [labnetik.com](https://labnetik.com/) though will most likey be taken down in
the near future.

Regardless of the outran financial runway, the goal of creating a solution that would quantifably help the industry
was met. A very ambitious and passionate team of engineers, designers, and business professionals came together to
create a product that was truly innovative and impactful in a space that was in dire need of it. Though Labnetik will
not be the product that transforms the industry, it will be the one to learn from for the next products that will ultimately
do so.

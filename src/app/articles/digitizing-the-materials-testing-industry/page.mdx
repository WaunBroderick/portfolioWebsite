The materials testing industry is the societal foundation that ensures that our civil structures are compliant, quality controled,
and of the highest safety standards. It is valued at USD $6.5B and has continued to grow year over year for decades. As populations
have increased so too have the demand for infrastructural buildings to facilitate their growth, increasing the demand beyond current
capabailites. To increase the efficiency and overall effectiveness the materials testing industry needed a solution that addressed their
accumulated innovational debt and ushered them into Industry 3.0.

## The Technology Stack <a name="technology"></a>

Labnetik starts with a fundamental design built to fit the needs of a decentralized organizational structure.
One comprised of several different stakeholders spanning different environments, responsibilities, with significantly different persona characteristics.
At its baseline there needed to be a product that provided a distinctly different set of workflows for each segment of users, a functions-first approach
facilitated through a native-mobile app and web-application. In a mono-repo with shared back-end services and two seperate front-ends we were able to create
a system that allowed for just that.

## The Architecture <a name="architecture"></a>

In Materials testing a significant amount of their work is facilitated by their satellite
testing laboratories ran by teams of dedicated technicians. The Data architecture
of our application decouples the organizational layers and allows the institution to separate,
the Organization into Laboratory entities, that then can hold or share various project identifiers.
This allowing an organization to fine-tune the passage of information between different
laboratories without any need for duplicate information or worries about data security.

With a flexible underline asset architecture we wanted to ensure that our user experience didn't
dead-lock the functionality of our overall application. Like the parent-child relationship of organizations
and laboratories, users can also be decoupled from organizations so they can belong to multiple laboratories,
or multiple organizations. Something that is important for technicians that sit between organizations, or
stakeholders overseeing processes.

To ensure this wasn't done at the cost of confidentiality, integrity, or availability, Labnetik ensures the
ability for organizations to self-govern their information access management through a robust and flexible
role or attribute base permissions system.

## The Workflow <a name="workflows"></a>

Labnetik did many things, but it's core foundation was an engine for business process automation. Due to the the
breadth of stakeholders,diversity in roles, and distributed locations the handling of documents was of the highest
importance. Labnetik needed the kernel of its innovation to start with digitizing and simplifying document handling.
That alone was no easy feat...

To go through all of the workflows that were ingested and broken down into; swimlanes, process diagrams, and
other visualizations would require more time than intended to take in this product document. Instead only one of the most
common workflows is visualized below. This is in itself an abstraction and simplification of a generic test, but has enough
information to provide a general understanding of the complexity of the workflows.

## Features <a name="features"></a>

With a shared reference of understanding we can start to examine some of the features that were built to facilitate
the needs of this workflow alone.

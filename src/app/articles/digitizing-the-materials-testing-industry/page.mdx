The materials testing industry is the societal foundation that ensures that our civil structures are compliant, quality controled,
and of the highest safety standards. It is valued at USD $6.5B and has continued to grow year over year for decades. As populations
have increased so too have the demand for infrastructural buildings to facilitate their growth, increasing the demand beyond current
capabailites. To increase the efficiency and overall effectiveness the materials testing industry needed a solution that addressed their
accumulated innovational debt and ushered them into Industry 3.0.

_A cloud full-stack web and mobile-native application that facilitates the testing, scientific calucations, and client liasing of the Materials Testing industry._

## The Technology Stack

Labnetik starts with a fundamental design built to fit the needs of a decentralized organizational structure.
One comprised of several different stakeholders spanning different environments, responsibilities, with significantly different persona characteristics.
At its baseline there needed to be a product that provided a distinctly different set of workflows for each segment of users, a functions-first approach
facilitated through a native-mobile app and web-application. In a mono-repo with shared back-end services and two seperate front-ends we were able to create
a system that allowed for just that.

## The Architecture

In Materials testing a significant amount of their work is facilitated by their satellite
testing laboratories ran by teams of dedicated technicians. The Data architecture
of our application decouples the organizational layers and allows the institution to separate,
the Organization into Laboratory entities, that then can hold or share various project identifiers.
This allowing an organization to fine-tune the passage of information between different
laboratories without any need for duplicate information or worries about data security.

With a flexible underline asset architecture we wanted to ensure that our user experience didn't
dead-lock the functionality of our overall application. Like the parent-child relationship of organizations
and laboratories, users can also be decoupled from organizations so they can belong to multiple laboratories,
or multiple organizations. Something that is important for technicians that sit between organizations, or
stakeholders overseeing processes.

To ensure this wasn't done at the cost of confidentiality, integrity, or availability, Labnetik ensures the
ability for organizations to self-govern their information access management through a robust and flexible
role or attribute base permissions system.

### Features

#### Report Generation

```
npm install --production
NODE_ENV=production node app
```

## Plugins

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins.
Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.

| Plugin           | README                                    |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Dropbox          | [plugins/dropbox/README.md][PlDb]         |
| GitHub           | [plugins/github/README.md][PlGh]          |
| Google Drive     | [plugins/googledrive/README.md][PlGd]     |
| OneDrive         | [plugins/onedrive/README.md][PlOd]        |
| Medium           | [plugins/medium/README.md][PlMe]          |
| Google Analytics | [plugins/googleanalytics/README.md][PlGa] |

## Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantaneously see your updates!

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

First Tab:

```
node app
```

Second Tab:

```
gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:

```
karma test
```

#### Building for source

For production release:

```
gulp build --prod
```

Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:

```
gulp build dist --prod
```

## Docker

Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the
Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to
build the image.

```
cd dillinger
docker build -t <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version} .
```

This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies.
Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual
version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on
your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to
port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart=always --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --name=dillinger <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

> Note: `--capt-add=SYS-ADMIN` is required for PDF rendering.

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in
your preferred browser.

```
127.0.0.1:8000
```
